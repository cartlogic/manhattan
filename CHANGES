Manhattan Changelog
===================

Version 0.3
-----------

- Restructure population assignment so that it returns consistent results
  independent of PYTHONHASHSEED. A side effect of this is that population
  allocations will change between 0.2 and 0.3: take care not to upgrade while
  tests are running.

Version 0.2
-----------

- Marking first stable production version (in use for over 6 months).
- Still not released.

Version 0.1
-----------

- Initial version, not released.
